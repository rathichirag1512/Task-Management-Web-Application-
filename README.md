# Deployment

Website is live you can access it on: https://to-do-uzui.onrender.com/

First of all "node-js" is required.

I have used 18.14.2 version for this project.

You can install it from: Here

To deploy this project run this project on your local enviroment you may download the zip file and extract everything from it .

Use any terminal and go to the project destinantion.

Personally I prefer to use Hyper-Terminal.

As I recommend if you download as zip file and then extract it then you can directly copy paste the following command after completing the extraction of all files, to go to the project folder :

 
 ```
 cd downloads/"Work-Organizer-main"/"Work-Organizer-main"
 ```
 
 If it does not work then simply paste the path where all the files of this particular project folder are present after
 'doenloads/'

 Then use the following command to install all the packages/ technologies used for this project:
 
 ```
  npm install 
  OR
  npm i
 ```
 
 Finally run the following command and the Web Application will start running on the port:3000
 
 ```
  nodemon app.js
 ```
 
 Hopefully if there are no erros then you will see the following message in your terminal/ console:
 
 ```
  Server has started successfully
  
 ```
 
 Then go to your browser and head type
 
 ```
  localhost:3000
 ```
 And see the project running.
